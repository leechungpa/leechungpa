# Chungpa Lee (이청파)

I am an integrated Ph.D. student in the Department of Statistics and Data Science at Yonsei University, currently working as a visiting researcher in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. My research focuses on the theoretical foundations of machine learning to understand when and why they succeed.
